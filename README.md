# C-HAT
Schematics and code for C-HAT loggers

Open-source, homebuilt dataloggers designed initially for work on lobsters.

C-HAT: Crustacean Heart and Activity Tracker

Arduino-based with substantial use of code snippets from Adafruit example libraries (among others).

Once the logger is built, set the clock with C-HAT_SetClock.ino, test the analog inputs with C-HAT_TestAnalogInputs.ino, and check the SD card with the CardInfo example from the SD library. If all that works out, load the main code and go do some science!
