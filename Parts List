Housing: GoPro or similar action camera housing (I use cheap knockoff versions of the Hero 8 housing from Amazon)
    Need to knock the lens out to let the IR sensor see outside
Battery: Sparkfun 2600 mAh 18650 Li-ion (fits perfectly into the GoPro housing)

Arduino boards and sensors:
  Adafruit Feather 32u4 Adalogger

  Adafruit LSM303AGR accelerometer and magnetometer breakout

Analog sensors:
  TCRT5000 IR emitter/detector pair

Miscellaneous parts:
    2 x 10kΩ resistors
    1 x 100Ω resistor
    1 x JST-PH connector (from battery to board)
    West System epoxy (or similar - for sealing the housing after removing the lens and adding sensors)


The whole package uses approximately 33 mA/hr, based on a few 80-hour long files using the 2600 mAh batteries in cold (5º C) water.
