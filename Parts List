Housing: GoPro or similar action camera housing (I use cheap knockoff versions of the Hero 8 housing from Amazon)
    Need to knock the lens out to let the IR sensor see outside
Battery: Sparkfun 2600 mAh 18650 Li-ion (fits perfectly into the GoPro housing)

Arduino boards and sensors:
  Adafruit Feather 32u4 Adalogger
    https://www.adafruit.com/product/2795
  Adafruit DS3231 Precision RTC Feather Wing
    https://www.adafruit.com/product/3028
  Adafruit LSM6DS3TR-C + LIS3MDL accelerometer and magnetometer breakout
    https://www.adafruit.com/product/5543
    (originally I used the Adafruit LSM6DS33+LIS3MDL (https://www.adafruit.com/product/4485) but that is no longer produced)
Analog sensors:
  TCRT5000 IR emitter/detector pair
    https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/vishay-semiconductor-opto-division/TCRT5000L/1681168
  DRV5053 linear Hall effect sensor

Miscellaneous parts:
  small rare earth magnet to attach to mandible - corresponds with Hall effect sensor
        https://www.kjmagnetics.com/proddetail.asp?prod=B112
  2 x 10kΩ resistors
  1 x 100Ω resistor
  1 x JST-PH connector (from battery to board)
  West System epoxy (or similar - for sealing the housing after removing the lens and adding sensors)


The whole package uses approximately 37-40 mA/hr, based on 62-72 hour runtimes using the 2600 mAh batteries in 15º C water.
